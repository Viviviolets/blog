        <h3>Bridging Programming Concepts and AI: Workshop Planning and Reflection</h3>
                <p>
When planning the workshop, I had various aims that I wanted to achieve. To ensure success, I broke these aims down into manageable steps to create a structured and engaging experience for the participants.
Introducing Programming Concepts in the Age of AI
The primary goal was to introduce high school girls from minority backgrounds to foundational programming concepts through the lens of Computational Thinking (CT) and AI frameworks. Given the rapid integration of AI into various aspects of life, we aimed to make programming feel both relevant and accessible.
<h4>Structuring Our Presentation</h4>
I carefully ordered the presentation to guide the participants from abstract concepts to concrete implementations. We started by teaching them how to think like programmers through algorithmic thinking. As an engaging icebreaker, the girls worked in groups to sort themselves based on their birthdays and follow array sorting rules. They effectively acted out a sorting algorithm with the help of our peer mentors, directing how it looks to loop through an array. This hands-on activity was designed to demonstrate how breaking down tasks into steps is essential to programming and give the girls an idea of how array store data and look through each one.
<h4>Connecting Algorithmic Thinking to Code</h4>
Next, we translated the sorting activity into code using AI tools. We incorporated this step for two reasons:
1.	To show how listing steps to solve a problem is reflected in code format, even when students might not know the specific syntax.
2.	To open a discussion about how students can use AI tools like ChatGPT in their day-to-day learning.
A CS student peer member and I critiqued the AI-generated code, providing a live demonstration of the output. While the generated code produced the correct results, we highlighted that it was unnecessarily complicated given the simplicity of the sorting technique the students had developed. This demonstration allowed us to introduce the idea that while AI is a powerful tool, understanding problem-solving fundamentals is key to recognizing better, more efficient approaches.
<h4>Wrapping Up: Why Algorithmic Thinking Matters</h4>
To conclude, we emphasized why algorithmic thinking is essential beyond the realm of programming. It is a critical tool for everyday life, from designing a cake recipe to planning a daily schedule. Developing problem-solving skills prepares students to navigate an AI-driven world with confidence.
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
I firmly believe that when students are equipped with strong problem-solving skills, they become less likely to overly rely on AI. By teaching them to reflect on current technology uses and encouraging them to think critically about solutions, we empower them to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
This workshop was a step toward that goal, and the experience taught us valuable lessons about how to better engage students with programming concepts and AI tools in meaningful, practical ways.
